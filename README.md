# Hi, I'm **[Wojix](https://github.com/Wojix)** 👋

I'm a student who loves building things on the internet.  
Currently exploring **Python**, **JavaScript**, and trying my best to study **English** (lol).

## What I do
- Learning how to write cleaner and smarter code
- Playing around with small web tools and APIs
- Slowly improving my English skills through projects and reading

## Tech I'm into
- **Python** for scripts and simple APIs  
- **JavaScript** for front-end experiments  
- Always curious about new stuff

## Goals
- Become fluent enough in English to code and communicate without breaking my brain  
- Build more projects that actually look cool

Thanks for stopping by!
